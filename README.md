This repository is to track my progress as I learn Sequelize, CRUD methodologies, and database logic using an e-commerce example.

## Example

The example I'm using is an e-commerce application with three main tables (product, category, and tag) and a pivot table named producttag that represents the many to many relationship between the product and tag tables.
